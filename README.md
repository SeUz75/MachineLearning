# MachineLearning
These are the task that I had in machine learning in Portugal. And my projects of course.


SOSOOSOSO this was my first project in Erasmus in the University of Coimbra, class : Advanced Machine Learning. We had to build a deep neural network which its being fed pictures of traffic signs and it is supervised learning so every picture belongs to a class, if you check the files you can see what im talking about number 6 -> dont turn right and etch. 

I uploaded this so in the future I can rebuild a new deep neural network better than the previous one.
Thats why I have the original. Dont mind the 2nd project in the Original file. I might upload it seperately because its too much GB and cant upload it.
